The Restaurant Mobile App allows users to browse the menu, make reservations, and place orders for delivery or pickup. The application provides an intuitive interface for customers to interact with the restaurant's services. The project includes a backend built using Python with Flask for handling business logic and data storage, and a mobile app built using React Native and TypeScript for providing a user-friendly interface.
